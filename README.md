# Guild-Predictions

## What is this?

This is just a bit of fun. I was trying to predict the scores in our lockdown zoom beer club using a Nural Net. It kind of works.

## How do I run it

Probably the easist way is with Google Colab. You can use this for free. 

If you're not comfortable using GIT then download the files and import them intoyour google drive. The Jupyter Notebooks (the .ipynb files) should open in colab if you double click them.

You may need to edit the path variable in the notebooks.
